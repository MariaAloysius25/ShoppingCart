Shopping cart using Vue and Vuex. 
If the item is already exist in cart then it will just update the quantity else new item will be added to cart.
Same for removing the item from cart.

Note:
	1. clone the project from github (https://github.com/MariaAloysius25/ShoppingCart.git)
	2. install the node modules as i have not uploaded the node modules in my git repository
	3. you run the project either in GUI or from command
